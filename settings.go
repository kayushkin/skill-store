//
// These are the three full variable names, not the shared prefix SKILL_STORE_,
// and the reason was measured on 2026-09-20. SKILL_STORE_URL is how the rest of
// the fleet finds this service: 62 references across the repos, and grant-store's
// unit sets it with Environment=. It is not in the server's own environment
// today, but cmd/seed builds this same registry and runs from an operator or
// agent shell, which inherits llm-bridge-server's environment — and
// llm-bridge-server declares SKILL_STORE_URL as one of its own settings, so
// setting it there is a supported act that would then stop cmd/seed. Owning the
// full names instead costs nothing that matters: servicesettings matches a
// prefix with HasPrefix, so SKILL_STORE_ADDRESS, SKILL_STORE_DATA_DIRECTORY and
// SKILL_STORE_INSTALL_DIRS are all still refused, while SKILL_STORE_URL passes.
// A misspelling that shortens a name, such as SKILL_STORE_ADR, is not caught.

// operator gate: GET /settings is as open as every other route.
